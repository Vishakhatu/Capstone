        "A branch of machine learning known as \"deep learning\" uses deep neural networks—which have many layers—to analyze and comprehend intricate patterns in data. It works especially effectively for problems like natural language processing, autonomous systems, and image and audio recognition. Deep learning models are not specifically programmed to carry out certain tasks; instead, they are meant to naturally learn from experience and get better at them."
